To run the luigi pipeline run this in your anaconda prompt (with luigi installed).
I've confirmed this working on my windows machine (even though I showed this to you on my linux system).

```bash
python run_luigi.py EDA --local-scheduler
```

If you want to install luigi:

```bash
pip install luigi
```
