2. [Tidy Data][2]
	- Tidy Data
		1. Each variable forms a column.
		2. Each observation forms a row.
		3. Each type of observational unit forms a table
	- Dirty Data
		1. Column headers are values, not variable names.
		2. Multiple variables are stored in one column.
		3. Variables are stored in both rows and columns.
		4. Multiple types of observational units are stored in the same table.
		5. A single observational unit is stored in multiple tables.

	1. Write programs for people, not computers.
	2. Let the computer do the work.
	3. Make incremental changes.
	4. Don't repeat yourself (or others).
	5. Plan for mistakes.
	6. Optimize software only after it works correctly.
	7. Document design and purpose, not mechanics.
	8. Collaborate.
