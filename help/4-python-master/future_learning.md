## Carpentries

I've been an instructor for Software/Data Carpentry (I.e., The Carpentries).
They have a good set of short (half day) crash course materials around
other tools used in Data Science, particularly Git, Bash, SQL, and Make

## DataCamp

A good list of courses from DataCamp to continue your learning journey.
For some of the classes, I've listed the chapters you can go through without taking the entire course.
The list of DataCamp courses are growing, but this should be a good place to start.
